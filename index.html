   <p><strong> "Hitler". </strong>
  It was this exactly message, published at 18:34 on 15 October during a virtual meeting on Google Meets, that made the <a href= "http://aliancalgbti.org.br/"> Brazilian National Alliance LGBTI+ </a> realize that was the target of a neo-Nazi hacker attack. </p>
          
          <p> That afternoon, the association was holding a virtual debate on fake news and hate speech. </p>
      <p> Minutes after the opening of the event, the 40 participants were exposed to insults, videos of violence with LGBTQ + flags setting on fire, half-naked people, Nazi soldiers and swastikas. </p>

          <p>The criminal episode reflects a phenomenon that has been occurring in Brazil in the last years: the expressive increase in the formation of neo-Nazi groups. </p>
          
      <p> According to the Anthropologist <b> Adriana Dias </b>, who has been researching and monitoring the activity of neo-Nazi cells in Brazil for 20 years, there has been an acceleration in the formation of these groups since 2016. </p>
          
          <p> “Until 2016, neo-Nazi groups in Brazil grew at a rate of 6% at 8% per year. Since the presidential campaign of Jair Bolsonaro, in 2018, the groups started to grow around 10% per year. Today the increase is 16% per semester”, Dias said.</p>
          <p> Brazil has 351 active neo-Nazi cells nowadays, and each cell is composed of 4 to 100 people,  according to the researcher. </p>
          
      <p> The NGO <a href="https://new.safernet.org.br/"> Safernet </a>, which monitors crimes on the web, also recorded the creation of 204 new pages dedicated to neo-Nazi content in May this year. In the same month in 2018, there were 28 new pages. It is an increase of 728%.  </p>
          
      <p> The trend is also confirmed by the <b> Brazilian Federal Police </b>. According to official data collected from Freedom of Information (FOI) Request, the number of federal investigations into cases of Nazi ideology promotion jumped 547% in the last two years. </p>

      <p> Promoting the Nazism is a crime in Brazil, determined by the Law number 7,716, approved in 1989, which also punishes up to three years in prison anyone who practice, induce or incite discrimination or prejudice of race, color, ethnicity, religion or national origin.  </p>
      
 <p> However, it is not difficult to find neo-Nazi demonstrations in Brazil. On 23 October, images of a possible neo-Nazi mobilization in São Paulo circulated on social media under the slogan “White lives matters”. </p>
 
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="pt" dir="ltr">Vários comentaram sobre a ação de grupos neonazi ontem em SP. Até onde pude averiguar, o ato foi autoria do núcleo SP Misanthropic Division, org. neonazi não raramente associada a atos de violência, de estrutura transnacional.<br><br>(vou adicionando o fio assim que tiver novidades) <a href="https://t.co/8LNZhd34ZN">pic.twitter.com/8LNZhd34ZN</a></p>&mdash; Odilon Caldeira Neto (@odiloncaldeira) <a href="https://twitter.com/odiloncaldeira/status/1330917244281511938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

 <p> The suspicion is that the participants in the act are linked to the Misanthropic Division (MD), a Ukrainian neo-Nazi organization that, despite its worldwide activities, recognizes only one official branch: the Brazilian. </p>
               
 <p> <h2 class="content-subhead"> What is happening in Brazil? 
      </h2> </p>
            <p> According to the Professor of History and specialist on far-right <b> Odilon Caldeira Neto </b>, in general, periods of political radicalization contribute to the intensification of these groups.       </p>
  
  <p> Another factor is the rise of populist leaders around the world. “Just as the election of Donald Trump led to the activation of more radical groups in the United States, neo-Nazi groups in Brazil see Bolsonaro as an example of this global phenomenon and tend to become more active. They feel legitimate to act”, Neto said. </p>
  
  <p> In Brazil, the speeches of members of the government in support of conservatism, misogyny, torturers, conspiracy theories and anti-communism create a fertile ground for neo-Nazi activities as well. </p>
  
  <p> "It does not mean that neo-Nazi groups see themselves in power, but they feel a more interesting atmosphere for action", Neto added. </p>

<p>  <h2 class= "content-subhead"> Who are the Brazilians neo-Nazi? 
    </h2> </p>
  
  <p> In the past, neo-Nazi groups were concentrated in the southern regions of Brazil, but today there are cells spread throughout the country, such as the northern and central-western regions, according to the research carried out by the Anthropologist Adriana Dias. </p>
  
 <p> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/4569645"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> </p>
  
  <p> Generally, the cells are made up of white men and women, from different income levels and ages, who have an attachment to a nostalgic past, "when the power of the white man was not threatened". </p>
  
  <p> "Some groups accept browns, which serve as proof that the group is not racist but, rather, racialist. They also stay ahead of actions that will confront the police and receive violence in place of the whites”, Dias said. </p>
  
  <p> The formation of neo-Nazi cells takes place in a rally: when people interested in creating a group begin to make an extrapolated communication to the society. </p>
  
  <p> "They put up posters, give indications that they are active in a certain location and how they can be found”, the  Anthropologist explained. </p>
  
  <p>The members of a neo-Nazi group usually communicate on the internet, in forums, websites,  and on the dark web, in addition to groups on Telegram. </p>
  
  <p> Each cell acts independently, with its members following the orders of the leaders. </p>
   <p> “But there is evidence that some cells are communicating with each other. And, if it starts to happen, we will have a big problem, because there will be a large neo-Nazi network forming in Brazil”, Dias warned. </p>
   <p> The independent performance is linked to the fact that each neo-Nazi group has its own narrative, its specific hate speech.
</p>
   <p>Some cells are more active in spreading domestic terrorism or in denying the Holocaust. Others are more religious, such as those linked to Christian Identity. There are also groups that promote white supremacy, those inspired by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), those that spread hate against the indigenous, or against Jews or homosexuals.    
 </p>
   <p> “Certain groups do not work with others because they act in separate spheres. Holocaust denialist groups have a more intellectual dimension than groups that want to reproduce tactics of extreme right-wing terrorism, for example”, Neto explained.  
</p>
  
  <p>  <h2 class="content-subhead"> Neo-Nazi groups are coming out of the closet
      </h2> </p>
  
   <p> It is precisely a group that disseminates hatred against homosexuals that has been persecuting the Brazilian activist <b>Toni Reis</b>, 56, president of the National Alliance LGBTI+. 
</p>
  
   <p>Since the invasion of the virtual meeting on 15th October, Reis has suffered several types of threats and persecutions.
 </p>
  
   <p> In the early hours of October 18, a neo-Nazi group sent meals via delivery to the activist's home.</p>
  
   <p>Four days later, WhatsApp groups of the Alliance were invaded with messages containing the swastikas. Then, a fake profile assigned to the email adolf@hitler.com sent swearing at Reis.  </p>

   <p> “We attribute these attacks to our achievements. We get most of the civil rights: getting married, adoption, gender identity, and blood donation. And all these things, for many people, are an affront”, Reis said.  </p>
  
   <p>“We also have a federal government today that makes extremely inhuman statements. They use homosexuality to make jokes and endorse the most aggressive speech. We came out of the closet, and the extreme right too”. </p>
